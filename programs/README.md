# yojoa-rs-secchi/programs

This directory contains the scripts that collate, harmonize, and generally munge the RS, Secchi, and meteorological data into a common file. The programs are numbered in the order that they were originally run.

## Script descriptions

* Script 1_RS_collate_harmonize.Rmd collates and harmonizes the output from GEE for the Yojoa in-lake locations

* 2_Process_Summarize_ERA5.Rmd summarizes the ERA5 meteorological data in 3, 5, and 7 day windows.

* 3_regionalRS_collate_harmonize.Rmd: similar to script 1, this script collates and harmonizes GEE output, but here, it does this for the regional set of lakes for the handoff correction

* 4_regional_handoff_calcs.Rmd: this script takes the regional stacks and calculates handoff coefficients to provide band reflectance values relative to Landsat 7.

* 5_apply_handoff_calcs.Rmd: this script applies the handoff calcs to the Yojoa in-lake location dataset

* 6_add_era5_data.Rmd: this script adds the ERA5 summaries to the band value correction dataset.

* 7_LSC2_secchi_matchup.Rmd creates the matchup files found in the `data/matchups` folder

Script 1_RS_collate_harmonize.Rmd assumes that you have run the Landsat stack files in the 'landsat_c2' folder within this repository or have access to the Drive folder with the output created in those scripts. You will not be able to run this code if you have not completed the LS stack run or if the output has not been shared with you.

-   Filters applied: in 1_RS_collate_harmonize.Rmd, we've done the minimum filtering in 'Filter scene summaries' (dswe1 must be \> 10, IMAGE_QUALITY \>= 7). We may suggest to update this with new filters in the near future.

-   The files sameDay_LS-Secchi_matchups.csv, oneDay..., twoDay..., threeDay..., fiveDay... found in the data folder were created in the script 2_LSC2_secchi_matchup.Rmd
